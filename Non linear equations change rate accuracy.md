The change rate (often referred to as the derivative) tends to have less error in non-linear equations compared to linear approximations because:

1. **Local Accuracy**: Non-linear equations capture the true behavior of a system more accurately than linear equations, especially when the relationship between variables is inherently non-linear. The derivative (rate of change) directly reflects this behavior, leading to more accurate local approximations.

2. **Higher-Order Terms**: In non-linear equations, the rate of change includes higher-order terms that account for curvature and more complex relationships. These terms help reduce the error that would arise if the change rate were approximated by a simpler linear model.

3. **Sensitivity to Changes**: Non-linear models are more sensitive to small changes in input variables. This sensitivity means that the derivative in a non-linear equation more precisely reflects how the system responds to changes, reducing the overall approximation error.

In summary, non-linear equations provide a more nuanced and detailed representation of a system's behavior, resulting in a change rate (derivative) that more accurately reflects the true dynamics, leading to less error.
