1. **Simplicity and Speed**: Naive Bayes assumes feature independence, leading to faster computation and scalability, especially with high-dimensional data.

2. **Robust to Irrelevant Features**: Performs well even if some features are irrelevant or the independence assumption is slightly violated.

3. **Low Data Requirement**: Effective with smaller training datasets due to its simple probabilistic assumptions.

4. **Ease of Implementation**: Straightforward to implement and interpret, making it suitable for many practical applications.
